__LyriksApp__<\br>
A music player ReactJS app with a modern homepage, fully-fledged music player, search, lyrics, song exploration features, search, popular music around you, and worldwide top charts.
This app uses __Shazam Api__, this API provides REST API endpoints that expose all of Shazamâ€™s features. So, it provides endpoints that allow detecting a song based on raw music data, searching for a song based on a phrase, providing song recommendations, listing the top tracks by country, and so on.<\br>
The UI was built using tailwind css.<\br>
This project helped me to understand how to use API behind the scenes.<\br>
